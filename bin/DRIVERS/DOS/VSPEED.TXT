VSpeed v1.10 - Freeware - VSPEED.TXT



VSPEED.EXE reports the video throughput for bit blit operations from DRAM to
VRAM for both the banked VGA and Linear Frame Buffer (LFB) mechanisms.
To test the LFB you should have a VESA 2.0 conforming driver. If your VESA
driver is not 2.0 compliant VSPEED will attept to determine the LFB address by
querying the PCI configuration registers. If neither method of determining the
LFB address succeeds, you can supply an LFB address (in hex) on the command
line. Otherwise the LFB will not be tested.

For your information (and to aid in debugging if there is a problem) VSPEED
will display information about the LFB address once it has started.
Press RETURN to continue on with the program.

Some VESA drivers appear to return an incorrect LFB address. If you experience
difficulties with VSPEED try using -L on the command line to eliminate the
linear frame buffer test. For example:

VSPEED -L

will test only the banked VGA mechanism.

VSPEED

will test both the banked VGA and the linear frame buffer determined from the
VESA driver of the PCI config registers.

VSPEED FF000000

will test both the banked VGA and the linear frame buffer using the user
supplied address.

VSPEED tests each of the two mechanisms for 5 seconds regardless of the bus
speed. This should increase the accuracy of the results on faster busses and
decrease the waiting time on slower busses.

Sample VSPEED results from a 200 MHz Pentium Pro motherboard with the B0
stepping of the 82450, a 4 MB Matrox MGA Millennium and FASTVID patches:

Copy DRAM to banked VGA:                87.72 million bytes per second
Copy DRAM to linear framebuffer:        93.46 million bytes per second
