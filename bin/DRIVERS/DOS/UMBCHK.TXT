UMBCHK
------


UMBCHK was made for UMBPCI 2.xx. It checks each 16KB block beween
C000 and EFFF if it contains either 00 only or FF only. If so, it
lists a block as 'OK', if not as 'used'. Then it caclulates a suitable
commandline for UMBPCI.


UMBPCI V3.xx has integrated this function, so UMBCHK is for information
purposes only.


Start it in pure DOS. Neither EMM386 nor UMBPCI shold be loaded. It
needs a 'clean' system.


Example:

On a Intel 440BX chipset without any extra BIOS blocks (USB, SCSI or whatever)
and with VGA card using a 32KB VGA-BIOS it looks so:


UMB-Checker for UMBPCI, (c)1999 by Uwe Sieber (uwe.sieber@gmx.de)

C000-C3FF : Used
C400-C7FF : Used
C800-CBFF : OK
CC00-CFFF : OK
D000-D3FF : OK
D400-D7FF : OK
D800-DBFF : OK
DC00-DFFF : OK
E000-E3FF : OK
E400-E7FF : OK
E800-EBFF : OK
EC00-EFFF : OK

If you want to use the paramter /I= then the
suggested parameter for UMBPCI is /i=C800-EFFF



Conclusion: 

With UMBPCI 3.xx the following lines have the same result:

device=c:\umbpci\umbpci.sys /i=c800-efff

device=c:\umbpci\umbpci.sys


Both would cause UMBPCI to use C800-EFFF.
